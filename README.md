# Reusable Functions

This program is designed to demonstrate functional, methodical, and critical thinking in JavaScript. It includes a variety of functions that perform tasks such as calculating the sum and average of an array, finding the longest string in an array, filtering and sorting arrays, and manipulating objects.

## Part 1: Thinking Functionally

The first part of the program includes functions that perform tasks on arrays. These tasks include:

- `myArraySum(arr)`: Calculates the sum of an array of numbers.
- `myArrayAverage(arr)`: Calculates the average of an array of numbers.
- `myArrayString(arr)`: Finds the longest string in an array of strings.
- `myStrArrLongerThanNum(arr, num)`: Returns an array of strings that are longer than a given number.
- `printOneToNumber(n)`: Prints every number between 1 and n using recursion.

## Part 2: Thinking Methodically

The second part of the program includes tasks that manipulate an array of objects. These tasks include:

- Sorting the array by age.
- Filtering the array to remove entries with an age greater than 50.
- Mapping the array to change the “occupation” key to “job” and increment every age by 1.
- Using the reduce method to calculate the sum of the ages and then using the result to calculate the average age.

## Part 3: Thinking Critically

The third part of the program includes tasks that manipulate objects. These tasks include:

- Takes an object and increments its age field.
- Takes an object, makes a copy, and increments the age field of the copy. Returns the copy.

This program is a demonstration of various JavaScript concepts and can be used as a reference for similar tasks.
